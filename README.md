# Docker and Docker Compose

This provides a starting point for experimenting with Docker and Docker Compose.

Try to modify the Dockerfile to install OCaml.
Then, you should be able to run:

```
docker-compose run lab ./run.sh
```

which will compile and run a trivial OCaml program, without you having installed OCaml on your machine!
